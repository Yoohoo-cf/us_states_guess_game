# U.S. States Guess Game

### Description

The U.S. States Guess Game is an interactive game that challenges players to name all 50 U.S. states. 
Players enter their guesses, and the game marks the states correctly guessed on a U.S. map. 
If the player chooses to exit the game before guessing all 50 states, a CSV file is generated with the states yet to be guessed.

### Features

1. Interactive map-based game using turtle graphics
2. Keeps track of correctly guessed states
3. Exports a CSV file (states_to_learn.csv) of states that haven't been guessed

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
turtle library
pandas library
